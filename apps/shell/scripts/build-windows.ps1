# Builds jobleft for Windows so that someone else can open it: the UI, the Node sidecar tree, and an NSIS installer
# per user (installMode: currentUser; WebView2 is fetched by the bootstrapper when a machine lacks it). This is the
# local counterpart of the installer step in .github/workflows/windows.yml, and it is the Windows answer to
# build-macos.sh, which signs, notarizes and staples; none of that has a Windows equivalent yet (the installer is
# not code-signed, so SmartScreen warns; that is expected and documented in apps/shell/README.md).
#
# Usage: apps/shell/scripts/build-windows.ps1 [--skip-smoke]
#   JOBLEFT_PUBLIK_APP_TOKEN     the public publik app token (pat_jobleft_...); without it the app starts without
#                                JOBLEFT_PUBLIK_ALLOW_LIVE=1, so "Connect to publik" is refused in plain words.
#                                It can also live in the git-ignored apps/shell/publik-app-token.local.
#   --skip-smoke                 build only; do not install, start, check health and stop the app afterwards.
#
# Needs the Visual Studio Build Tools with the MSVC C++ x64/x86 build tools component for cl.exe
# (Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64; "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools" is its name on
# VS 2022). cl.exe does not have to be on PATH: cargo finds it through the same Visual Studio detection CI relies on.
#
# Unless --skip-smoke is passed, it then smoke-tests the installer it just built: it removes the previous install,
# installs over it, starts the app against a scratch JOBLEFT_HOME under %TEMP%, checks health, and stops it again.
# Quit any running jobleft.exe first, because the single-instance plugin hands a second launch to the running one and
# this launch would then never write a run file. The install folder it replaces is %LOCALAPPDATA%\jobleft under
# installMode currentUser (%ProgramFiles%\jobleft otherwise); the data folder (%APPDATA%\jobleft) is never touched.
